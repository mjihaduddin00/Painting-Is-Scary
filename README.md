# Painting-Is-Scary
This is my assignment submission where I was tasked to create a site for a paint store during a seasonal holiday (Halloween). This site utilizes HTML and CSS.

The images are not viewable due to them being resources/property of the organization. Thus, they have not been added to this repository.

However, you can view the structure and setup of the overall site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Painting-Is-Scary/

Thanks!
